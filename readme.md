# CRUD Event Web App

'clubKid' is the second project I've created during an intensive 3-month bootcamp at Ironhack.

This project functions as intended. Although, it continues to be a **work in progress**.


## Overview

This is a fullstack web app.

### The idea

On a team of three people including myself, we've developed a website in 5 days where signed in users can search, add, edit and delete local club events.

### What can a user do?

-   Auth: Signup & Login
-   Passport.js Auth: Signup & Login via Github account
-   Create, edit, and remove your event listings
-   Mapbox.js: View the mapped location of the event 
-   Filter events by date and search keywords. 


## Built with

-   HMTL/CSS
-   Javascript
-   Node.js
-   Mongoose
-   Express
-   MongoDB
-   Passport.js
-   Mapbox.js
-   Handlebars.js
-   bcrypt.js
-   axios


## Getting Started

-   This project has a server (root dir) and a client (client dir). 
-   For local dev, run these commands in each of them.

```Console
npm install
```
```Console
npm start
```

Alternatively, you can view the <a href="https://club-kid.herokuapp.com/">deployed project</a>
